Project Description:

Your toy company wants to launch a new teddy bear toy in multiple countries/regions. For compliance reasons, the infrastructure must be spread across all the Azure regions where the toy will be launched.

You needed to deploy the same resources in multiple locations and a variety of environments. You wanted to create flexible Bicep templates that you can reuse, and to control resource deployments by changing the deployment parameters.

To deploy some resources only to certain environments, you added conditions to your template. You then used copy loops to deploy resources into various Azure regions. You used variable loops to define the properties of the resources to be deployed. Finally, you used output loops to retrieve the properties of those deployed resources.

Without the conditions and copy loops features, you'd have to maintain and use multiple versions of Bicep templates. You'd have to apply every change in your environment in multiple templates. Maintaining all these templates would entail a great deal of effort and overhead. By using conditions and loops, you were able to create a single template that works for all your regions and environments and ensure that all your resources are configured identically.

Azure SQL Deployment Project. 
This project showcases how to deploy Azure SQL resources using Bicep for defining Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. 
With Bicep, we automate the deployment of Azure SQL servers, databases, and auditing settings across multiple Azure regions.

Generated Resources:

Azure SQL Server:
A SQL server instance is deployed in each specified Azure region, configured with the provided administrator login credentials.
The server names are dynamically generated based on the Azure region and a unique identifier.

Azure SQL Database:
A SQL database is provisioned under each SQL server instance with the specified name and SKU.
The database name remains consistent across all deployments.

Auditing Settings:
Auditing settings are configured for each SQL server instance to enable auditing if the environment is set to 'Production'.
An audit storage account is provisioned for each enabled auditing setting, ensuring compliance with security requirements.
The audit storage account name is dynamically generated based on the Azure region and a unique identifier.

Features:

Modular Deployment: 
The project uses Bicep's modular approach to organize and manage Azure SQL deployments efficiently. Each module focuses on specific SQL resources and configurations, promoting reusability and maintainability.

Dynamic Resource Configuration: 
With Bicep, resource properties and settings are dynamically configured based on parameters provided at deployment time. This allows for flexible and customizable SQL deployments tailored to different Azure regions and environments.

Loops and Conditions: 
Bicep's loops and conditions are utilized to automate repetitive tasks and control the flow of SQL deployments. This enables handling of complex scenarios, such as deploying SQL resources across multiple Azure regions.
Security Best Practices: The project prioritizes security by implementing secure parameters and sensitive information handling using Bicep's secure decorators. This ensures that sensitive data, such as SQL server login credentials, are protected during deployment.
